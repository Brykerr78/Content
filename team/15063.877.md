- Fixes an issue with printing PDFs in Microsoft Edge
- Fixes an issue with the App-V package folder access that cause the access control list to be handled incorrectly
- Fixes an issue where backwards compatibility for managing Microsoft User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) with group policy is lost.

This means that some of the new, additional settings for Windows 10 aren't available
