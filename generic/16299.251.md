## Fixed issues
- Fixes an issue where some USB devices and onboard devices, such as a built-in laptop camera, keyboard, or mouse, stop working. This may occur when the Windows Update servicing stack incorrectly skips installing the newer version of some critical drivers in the cumulative update and uninstalls the currently active drivers during maintenance
- Fixes an issue where some devices may fail to boot with "INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE"
