### Fixed issues
- Fixed an issue where the copy operation fails when copying a file that has Encrypted File System (EFS) encryption to a share that is not encrypted by EFS
- Fixed an issue where CredentialGuard-enabled computers joined to Active Directory domains submit two bad logon attempts each time a bad password is provided during a Kerberos-based logon. Logons to Active Directory domains with arbitrarily low account lockout thresholds may be subject to unexpected account lockouts. For example, 2 logons with a bad password could result in an account being locked out if the account lockout threshold is set to 3 or 4
- Fixed an issue that prevents the launch of the Delete Browsing History window in Internet Explorer
- Fixed a memory leak in Internet Explorer when hosting pages containing nested framesets that load cross domain content
- Fixed an additional issues with updated time zone information, updates to the Access Point Name database and Internet Explorer
- Security updates to Scripting Engine, libjpeg image-processing library, Hyper-V, Win32k, Adobe Type Manager Font Driver, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Graphics component, .NET Framework,  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, Windows kernel mode drivers and Windows OLE
