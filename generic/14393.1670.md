### Fixed issues
- Fixes an issue where Update History and hidden updates are lost and a full scan for updates happens after installing OS Updates 14393.1532 through 14393.1613, including KB4034658. Installing this update will not restore past update history or hidden updates for users who have already installed the listed updates. However, this current update will address this issue for users who have not yet installed them
- Fixes an issue with WSUS update metadata processing that can cause some clients to time out with a 0x8024401c error
