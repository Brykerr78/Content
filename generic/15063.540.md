### Fixed issues
- Fixes an issue where the policies provisioned using Mobile Device Management (MDM) should take precedence over policies set by provisioning packages
- Fixes an issue where the Site to Zone Assignment List group policy (GPO) was not set on machines when it was enabled
- Fixes an issue where the AppLocker rules wizard crashes when selecting accounts
- Fixes an issue where the primary computer relationship is not determined when you have a disjoint NetBIOS domain name for your DNS Name. This prevents folder redirection and roaming profiles from successfully blocking your profile or redirects folders to a non-primary computer
- Fixes an issue where an access violation in the Mobile Device Manager Enterprise feature causes stop errors
- Security updates to Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Windows Search Component, Microsoft Scripting Engine, Microsoft Windows PDF Library, Windows Hyper-V, Windows Server, Windows kernel-mode drivers, Windows Subsystem for Linux, Windows shell, Common Log File System Driver, Internet Explorer, and the Microsoft JET Database Engine
