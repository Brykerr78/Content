### Fixed issues
- Fixes an issue that wasÂ preventing the Camera application from saving a captured image when "Show recently opened items in Jump Lists on Start or the taskbar" settings is enabled
- Fixes an issue where CredentialGuard-enabled computers joined to Active Directory domains submit two bad logon attempts each time a bad password is provided during a Kerberos-based logon. Logons to Active Directory domains with arbitrarily low account lockout thresholds may be subject to unexpected account lockouts. For example, 2 logons with a bad password could result in an account being locked out if the account lockout threshold is set to 3 or 4
- Fixes an issue that might sometimes lead to updates not getting installed on machines due to file corruption
- Fixes an issue with devices using certificate-based WLAN authentication to not automatically renew their certificates when the devices are in sleep mode
- Fixes an issue that prevents users from accessing data stored in remote encrypted shares even when offline caching is not enabled
- Fixes an issue where a memory leak occurs in Internet Explorer when hosting pages containing nested framesets that load cross domain content
- Fixes additional issues with updated time zone information and updates to the Access Point Name database and Internet Explorer
- Security updates to Scripting Engine, libjpeg image-processing library, Hyper-V, Win32k, Adobe Type Manager Font Driver, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Graphics component, .NET Framework, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, Windows Kernel mode drivers and Windows OLE
