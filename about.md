### Why certain things may seem odd
We've got some practices that might make you scratch your head. Here is why:

- We list **Microsoft Edge** as version 12 and 13 in Threshold R1 and Threshold R2 respectively, yet the actual numbers are 20 and 25. This is simply because the version 12 and 13 notation are a continuation on the version of Internet Explorer. We use the EdgeHTML version instead because this way we identify 1 single development cycle with just 1 version number. Hence why we refer to the Redstone R1-version of Edge as Edge 14 instead of whatever the shell's number is.

### What we don't keep track off
While we try to be as complete as possible, there are some things that we simply don't keep track off. Some for a number of reasons.

- **Leaked builds** are only enlisted if the leaked build is newer than the most recent official build. When a new official build is released that is on its own newer again, we'll remove the leaked build from our list.
- **Patches for desktop** are not listed, we do keep track of patches (the cumulative updates) on Mobile, but for desktop/tablets it is simply to complex to provide a (full) changelog.
- **Server and Xbox**, that is, not yet.

### The 1.000.000.000-goal
The 1.000.000.000-goal chart is an estimation based on marketshare when Microsoft announced previous milestones compared to the current marketshare. There is a certain margin of error. The actual number might be higher.
