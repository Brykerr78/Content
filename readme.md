### ...to the Windows changelogs
It could happen that we miss out on a feature that's new in one build of Windows, or that a feature is in the wrong place, or if we made a spelling mistake. If that's the case, please tell us! You can do so by creating a pull request or opening a new ticket. The following requirements apply:

- Start your pull request or ticket with [BUILD], where BUILD is replace by the build number of the feature your submit
 - E.g. [10532] New unified context menus
- We would like you to include steps to find a feature you submit in case it isn't easy to find
- Do not submit any subjective information, we want to stay objective on this, no rumors
- If there is a (spelling)mistake in a feature that already has been listened, you can open a new ticket or pull request to remove it or fix it, again with the [BUILD]-syntax, and a short description of the issue
 - E.g. [10041] Edge wasn't added in build 10041, but in 10049
 
We would rather not have you push new files for builds that aren't covered yet to this repository, we'll make an initial draft ourselves and publish it to this repository and ChangeWindows.org first.

### ...to ChangeWindows
In case you have some nice ideas for the website itself, we would like to hear it to! Again, you can open a ticket and describe the new feature as well as possible. Of course, the actual code won't be published here.

## FAQ

**Can we add images?**

Yes, however, we usually do this ourselves due to the following requirements (but if you're image applies to it, feel free):
- The image resolution for desktop must be 1824p on a 2:3 ratio (or rather: a Surface Pro 4) and scaling must be set to 200%
 - For Mobile, Server, Xbox and IoT there are no restrictions
- It must have the default wallpaper of that build as its background
- The screenshot must show off some of the larger changes in this build (if applicable) (for 10158, for example, that was the Edge branding, new browser and new toggles in Action Center)

**This is on GitHub, can we use it for free?**

No, keep in mind that ChangeWindows is like any other news website, our content is not freely available for anyone to copy, credits are required if you use us as a source.
