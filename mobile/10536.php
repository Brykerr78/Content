<p>Microsoft announced the release of build 10536 for mobile devices but cancelled the update shortly before the full roll-out began due to a bug that made it impossible to upgrade to future builds. The update was already staged and build 10536.1003 was rolled out to 200 Windows Insiders. While this is a very small roll-out, we do concider it a public release and are thus listening September 11, 2015 as this build's release date. This build was re-released as 10536.1004 on September 15, 2015.</p>
<h2>What's new in Windows 10 Mobile build 10514.0?</h2>
<p>When upgrading from 10512, Windows Insiders will also get build 10514 delivered. This build is required to overcome an upgrading issue. Upgrading from Windows Phone 8.1 won't trigger this build.</p>
