## Accidental release
Microsoft announced the release of build 10536 for mobile devices but cancelled the update shortly before the full roll-out began due to a bug that made it impossible to upgrade to future builds. The update was already staged and build 10536.1003 was rolled out to 200 Windows Insiders. While this is a very small roll-out, we do concider it a public release and are thus listening September 11, 2015 as this build's release date. This build was re-released as 10536.1004 on September 15, 2015.

## Build 10514 requirement
When upgrading from 10512, Windows Insiders will also get build 10514 delivered. This build is required to overcome an upgrading issue. Upgrading from Windows Phone 8.1 won't trigger this build.
