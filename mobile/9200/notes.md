### Build string
Note that the listed build string and compilation date are not correct. Due to the way ChangeWindows is build, a build string has to be given for every build, however, the Windows Phone 8 build string is unknown, therefor we're using the Windows 8 build string. Windows Phone 8 and all 3 of its updates are listed as build 9200 but this information we cannot confirm, neither branch name, revision or timestamp are accurate.
